**Nomologically Valid:** no counter examples that do not violate the laws of nature
**Conceptually Valid:** no counter examples that do not violate the conceptual connections between words
**Formally valid:** when validity is dependent on Form rather than context of the premises
A is either an X or a Y . 
A isn’t a Y . ∴A is an X . 
                          Can we find a counterexample?

**Validity:** Rules out the possibility of the premises and conclusions not being true at once -
It is possible for the conclusion to be false but the argument valid-If the conclusion is false then one of the premises must be false-
Not about the actual truth or falsity of sentences, it is about whether it is possible for all premises to be true and conclusion to not be true-
**Soundness:** Argument is sound if it is both valid and all its premises are true-
**Inductive arguments:** generalises observations about past events to a conclusion about future cases
It is still possible fro that conclusion to be refuted with a counter example-
**Entailment:** The realtionship between premises and conclusion-

**Practice Questions:**

A:
1. Valid
2. Valid
3. Invalid
4. Valid
5. Invalid
6. Invalid

B:
1. True

**Joint possibility:** Joint impossibility: Sentences that are not possible to be true at once 
If the sentences are joint impossible, you cannot add another sentence to fix it
○ If the premises are join impossible –> the argument is valid
○
-
**Joint Possible:** all sentences must be possible to exist at the same time-
**Necessary Truths, Necessary Falsehoods and contingencies:**
**Contingent:** a sentence that is capable of being true and capable of being false -
**Truth:** Something that is just true in general-
**Falsehood:** A sentence that is impossible -
**Equivalence:** when two sentences have the same truth-value in every case
These sentences are typically similar to each other, if one is false then the other also has to be false (vice 
versa)-
John went to the store after he washed the dishes. 
John washed the dishes before he went to the store. 
A If A, then C 
∴C

**Conceptually Valid:** the concepts carry through
Arguments are not valid based solelyon their form

**TFL:** Truth Functional logic
**Atomic Sentences:** Add subscripts to letters to represent subsentences and use a symbolization key such as:
A: It is raining outside ○C : Jenny is miserable -
**Logical Connectives:**
**Negation:** "it is not the case that" or "not" the sentence –you are negating the sentence
○ It is possible to have a double negation given the conditions 

7. Jane is happy.
8. Jane is unhappy. Sentence 8 is its own sentence because it could be that Jane is neither happy or unhappy –and it is not 
the same thing as "It is not the case that Jane is happy"-
-

**Conjunction:** We use it to deal with "and", it is used to connect two subsentences together. The subsentences are 
the conjuncts of the conjunction.-It does not matter if you have multiple conjunctions-
Even if you are referring to one subject, you still must define the two subtences-
A sentence can be symbolized as (A ∧B) if it can be paraphrased in English as ‘Both..., and...’, or as ‘..., 
but ...’, or as ‘although ..., ...’. -You can ignore "but"-
-

**Disjunction:** subsentences are the disjuncts of the disjunction-
A sentence can be symbolized as (A ∨B) if it can be paraphrased in English as ‘Either. . . , or. . . .’ -Exclusive or: Excludes the possibility of both of them being true-
Inclusive or: Allows for the possibility of both -
-

**Conditional:** 'If P, then F' use '→'  to symbolize 'if...then...' format when P and F are subsentences
P is the Antecedent of the conditional§F is the Consequent of the conditions§-
Be careful as the sentence may be different if the subsentences are switched-
A sentence can be symbolized as (A → B) if it can be paraphrased in English as ‘If A, then B’ or ‘A only if 
B’. Can have many forms –look out for this§
Tells us that only if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true§Does not discuss a casual connection between two events§
-
-

**Biconditional:** Amounts to stating things both directions of the conditional-
‘(D → M) ∧(M → D)’ = (D ↔ M ) -New Terminology:
'if'–the English conditional§'iff'–the English biconditional§-
A sentence can be symbolized as (A ↔ B) if it can be paraphrased in English as ‘A iff B’; that is, as ‘A if and only if B’. -
-

**Unless:** A special case
J : You will wear a jacket 
D: You will catch a cold Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold. (¬J →D) -
You will catch a cold unless you wear a jacket. (¬D → J ) -OR (J ∨D)  –Both sentences are equal in their meanings as such this symbolization works too, it is not 
possible for these two happen at the same time-All Three of these are considered to be equal-
If a sentence can be paraphrased as ‘Unless A, B,’ then it can be symbolized as ‘(A∨B)’. -This can get complicated when interpreting speech in the english language because unless can be used as a 
biconditional in regular speech-

**Expression of TFL:** Any string of symbols of TFL
**Sentences of TFL:** An  Inductive definition
Every Sentence letter is a sentence-If A is a sentence then -A is also a sentence-
If A and B are sentences, then (A <any connective> B) is a sentence-Nothing else is a sentence.-
**Main Logical Operation:** A sentential connective that is introduced last-
We can find it by:If the first symbol in the sentence is ¬ then that is the main logical operator-
Otherwise, count brackets. For each open bracket, add 1, for each closing one, subtract 1, when the counter is at exactly 1, the first operator you hit (apart from ¬) is the main logical operator-
-

**Scope of Negation:** The scope of '¬' is the subsentence for which '¬' is the main logical operator
**Scope of a connective:** the subsentence for which that connective is the main logical operator
**Bracket Conventions:** Allowed to omit the outermost bracket of the sentence-
In more complex sentences, we can use '[...]' for faster reading-

**Ambiguity**
**Lexical Ambiguity:** when a sentence contains a word[s] that can have multiple meanings
**Structural Ambiguity:** a sentence can be interpreted in different ways.
**Vagueness:** when something is not specified yet rather described, (i.e. "tall" but in what context?)
Sentences in TFL cannot be structurally ambigous
**Scope ambiguities:** depend on whether or not a connective is in the scope of another
**Quotation Conventions:** Indicate that you are moving from talking about an object to talk about a name of that object-
**Object Language and metalanguage:** Object Language: TFL-
Metalanguage: English-Difference between these two is in their exactness-
**Metavariables:** Augmented metalanguage that is used to talk about any expression of TFL-
i.e. Cursive A is used to describe the expressions of TFL while A is a specific sentence letter of TFL-
**Quotation conventions for arguments:** TFL cannot identify cert-
ain sentences as premises and conclusions-Notation: -
-
"therefore" is not part of object language, is part of metalanguage-

**Truth Tables:**
**Negation:**
**Conjunction:** If A and B are then True
-
-
**Disjunction:** IF A or B is true then True (inclusive or)
-
-
**Conditional:** If A is true then B is True
-
-
**Biconditional:** Both must be true for the expression to evaluate to true
-
-

The idea of Truth Functionality:A connective is Truth-functional iff the truth value of a sebtebce with that connective as its main 
operator is uniquely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent sentence(s)-Every connective in TFL is truth-functional.-
To determine the turth value of a TFL sentence, we only need to know the truth value of its componenets.-"It is necessarily the case" is not truth-functional-
**Symbolizing vs. Translating:** All connectives of TFL map us between truth values-
TFL ignores the subtleties of of the original text which enhance it beyond just truth values-It also cannot capture the subtle differences between sentences.-
TFL cannot work with meaning as well-When we treat a TFL sentence as symbolizing an English sentence, we are stipulating that the TFL sentence is 
to take the same truth value as that English sentence.-
**Indicative vs. Subjunctive conditionals:** The truth value of the sentence is not uniquely determined by the truth value of the parts-
Subjunctive conditionals ask us to imagine something contrary to fact, and then ask us to evaluate what would have happened in that case-
**Complete truth tables:** We can assign truth values directly: A valuation-
A valuation is any assignment of truth values to particular sentence letters of TFL.-Each row of the truth table represents a possible valuation, the complete table represents all the possible 
valuations –It allows us to calculate the truth value of complex sentences -The values under the main logical operator tell us the value of the sentence
-
-
A complete truth tablehas a line for every possible assignment of True and False to the relevant sentence letters. Each line is a valuationand the truth able has a line for all the different valuations-
The size of said truth table can vary based on the number of sentence letters in the table.A sentence that only needs 1 sentence letter requires only two rows (for T and F)-
This is true even if the same letter is repeated multiple times-
-
We can continue this trend inifinitely based on the number of sentence letters we have.-For example, with 3 letters:
A rule for this is that if we have n different sentence letters, then the table must have 2n rows/lines-
-

To fill the columns, start from right to left
At the right most, alternate between T and F1.
In the next column to its left, write two T's and two F's and alternate/repeat2.In the next left column, write 4 T's and 4 F's and alternate/repeat3.
Continue this trend...4.RULE: -
Column Index(i)3210
2iT & F8 T & F4 T & F2 T & F1 T & F
-

**Brackets:** If the same connective is used (conjuction or disjunction) throughout a sentence, then associative property 
applies.-Example: Logically equivalent sentences
-
We should not write: A v B v C-Associative property does notapply to conditionals, or if there is variation of the conjunctions and 
disjunctions in the sentence, then the order of the brackets is important and there is no logical equivalence-Example of conditionals:
Example of Variation:
It is then needless to say that we cannot write these without their brackets, it would be far to ambiguous

**Semantic Concepts:**
The surrogate for a necessary truth is a tautology: A is a tautology iff it is true on every valuation. We can use truth tables to determine this and further concepts.
There are some necessary truths that we cannot adequately symbolize in TFL, an example of this "2+2 = 4".-This must be true however we cannot represent it in TFL since it would only be a sentence letter and no 
sentence letter can be a tautology by itself
As such, the opposite to this is a contradiction: A is a contradiction iff it is false on every valuation
Another variation of this is equivalance: A and B are equivalent iff for every valuation, their truth values are the same.
An example of this:-
The surrogate for jointly possible is jointly satisfiable: A1, A2,..., Anare jointly satisfiable iff there is some valuation which makes them all true.
Similar to this, we can develop the idea of entailment: The   A1, A2, . . . , Anentail (in TFL) the sentence C iff no valuation of the relevant sentence letters makes all of A
1, A2, . . . , Antrue and C false.An example of this is:
If A1, A2, . . . , Anentail C in TFL, then A1, A2, . . . , An∴C is valid.This is because if we assume that A
1, A2, . . . , An entails C then there is also no valuation that makes A1, A2, . . . , Antrue and also makes C false-
The test for this is to first symbolize them in the TFL and then use the truth tables to test their entailment.-
The double turnstileshall be defined as the symbol for entailment:  A1, A2, . . . , An ⊨CThis is not a symbol of TFL rather it is a symbol of metalanguage -
P,P →Q ⊨Q is the same thing as The TFL sentences ‘P ’ and ‘P →Q ’ entail ‘Q’-
Some special cases of the turnstil are as follows:⊨C
Since there are no sentences on the left side of the turnstile, this simply means that there is no valuation that makes C false, as such ever valuation makes C true. -
Thus C is a tautology
-
A ⊨Similarly, for this case: we can say that A is a contradiction--
Furthermore, to say: it is not the case that A 1, . . . , A n ⊨C, we can say A 1, A 2, . . . , A n ⊭CThis means that some valuation makes all of A
1, A2, . . . , Antrue whilst making C false, this is not the same is A1, A2, . . . , An⊨¬C since it is possible that some other valuat
