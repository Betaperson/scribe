We can use truth tables to determine this and further concepts.There are some necessary truths that we cannot adequately symbolize in TFL, an example of this \"2+2 = 4\".- This must be true however we cannot represent it in TFL since it would only be a sentence letter and no sentence letter can be a tautology by itselfAs such, the opposite to this is a contradiction: A is a contradiction iff it is false on every valuation\n",

      "The surrogate for jointly possible is jointly satisfiable: A1, A2,…, Anare jointly satisfiable iff there is some valuation which makes them all true.\n",
      "Similar to this, we can develop the idea of entailment: The   A1, A2, . . . , Anentail (in TFL) the sentence C iff no valuation of the relevant sentence letters makes all of A1, A2, . . . , Antrue and C false.An example of this is:\n",
      "If A1, A2, . . . , Anentail C in TFL, then A1, A2, . . . , An∴C is valid.This is because if we assume that A1, A2, . . . , An entails C then there is also no valuation that makes A1, A2, . . . , Antrue and also makes C false-\n",
      "The test for this is to first symbolize them in the TFL and then use the truth tables to test their entailment.-\n",
      "The double turnstileshall be defined as the symbol for entailment:  A1, A2, . . . , An ⊨CThis is not a symbol of TFL rather it is a symbol of metalanguage - P,P →Q ⊨Q is the same thing as The TFL sentences ‘P ’ and ‘P →Q ’ entail ‘Q’-\n",
      "Some special cases of the turnstil are as follows:⊨C Since there are no sentences on the left side of the turnstile, this simply means that there is no valuation that makes C false, as such ever valuation makes C true. -\n",
      "Thus C is a tautology\n",
      "-\n",
      "A ⊨Similarly, for this case: we can say that A is a contradiction--\n",
      "Furthermore, to say: it is not the case that A 1, . . . , A n ⊨C, we can say A 1, A 2, . . . , A n ⊭CThis means that some valuation makes all of A1, A2, . . . , Antrue whilst making C false, this is not the same is A1, A2, . . . , An⊨¬C since it is possible that some other valuation makes  A1, A2, . . . , Antrue and makes C true.-\n",
      "As such: P ⊭Q but also P ⊭¬Q.\n",
      "‘⊨’ versus ‘→’A ⊨C iff no valuation of the sentence letters makes A true and C false.- A → C is a tautology iff no valuation of the sentence letters makes A →C false.- A → C is a tautology iff A ⊨C- ‘→’ is a sentential connective of TFL.- ‘⊨’ is a symbol of augmented English.- When we use the turnstile we are forming a metalinguistic sentence that mentions the surrounding TFL sentences-\n",
      "Limitations of TFLTFL is not expressive enough to symbolize everything we might want to so that we can use the skills we have - Sentence letters cannot be allowed to take truth values other than True or False, it cannot capture the intended truth conditions-\n",

      "The very idea of natural selection:Truth tables cannot give us much insight in certain cases where different forms of reasoning are present- The aim of a natural deduction system is to show that particular arguments are valid in such a way that we understand the reasoning the arguments involved.-\n",
